## forcasting-retail-stored-demand

This project demonstrates how to apply a machine learning model to predict product demand in a retail store setting.

The model takes 7 input features:
Price, Discount, Promotion, Competitor Pricing, Units Sold, Weather Condition, and Seasonality.

I used an XGBoost Regressor for training. After evaluation, the model achieved:

✅ RMSE: 24.05

✅ R² Score: 0.737

Finally, the results are visualized through an interactive Streamlit web app.
